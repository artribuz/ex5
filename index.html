            <h2>The Shining</h2>
            <p>This movie is hella sketchy. I'm not usually one for scary movies, but I heard this one was more creepy than scary. Wow they were right. Jack Nicholson's face pretty much the entire movie is terrifying. Not only that but apparently they told the kid that he was filming a drama, not a horror movie. Not gonna lie, I feel like I would've figured that out I was shooting a horror movie sooner.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="tabs-2">
            <h2>Serenity</h2>
            <p>I was so looking forward to this movie when I watched it. If you're familiar with the short-lived series "Firefly" then you will understand my pain. Serenity is supposed to be the epic conclusion to the singular season of "Firefly," but the explanations that it provided to all of the unexplained plot lines of the show made it more confusing and convoluted. I had high hopes, but Joss Whedon settled for killing off the best side characters and making River a brainwashed badass with a sword.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="tabs-5">
            <h2>The Winter Soldier</h2>
            <p>Oh ho ho ho. So trixy. The search function in the chosen.js library searched for the letter S anywhere in the text for the options of the drop down menu. Isn't that cool? I think it's cool.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I've only seen The Winter Solder once and I don't really remember all that much of it besides Bucky Barnes comes back as a brainwashed Hydra operative with a metal arm. I thought it was just more of a convenient plot device to make Captain America have a friend that isn't Black Widow around and feel conflicted about hurting him or something. Either way, it was a pretty good Avengers installment and I do wanna watch it again</p>
        </div>
        <div id="tabs-3">
            <h2>Silver Linings Playbook</h2>
            <p>This is one of my favorite movies by far. Although Jennifer Lawrence seems to be a little too young for the part she's supposed to be playing, it didn't matter for this movie. It explores different mental illnesses that most people can overlook or aren't necessarily obvious. Everyones performance is on point, which makes this movie one of my favorite dramas/rom-coms. 10/10 would recommend if you haven't seen it already</p>
        </div>
        <div id="tabs-4">
            <h2>The Secret of Kells</h2>
            <p>All my designer friends out there, you should watch this movie. It is the most beautifully animated movie I have ever seen. It uses tons of celtic art styles, like celtic knots, built into the environment, plus insanely beautiful character and environment design. Not only that but the plot is pretty good too and the message is also important, that art is just as important as everything else that a civilization needs. Seriously, if you haven't seen this movie, you should watch it...like right now.</p>
